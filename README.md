[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MircoGanz/Refrigeration-Cycle-Simulation.git/HEAD)

A newly developed framework for simulating thermo-hydraulic systems is illustrated on two examples of refrigeration cycles:
1. One-Stage DX cycle;
2. CO2/R134a cascade cycle.

The simulation results are validated with experimental data measured in the Institute of Energy Systems and Fluid Engineering ([IEFE](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/iefe/)), ZHAW School of Engineering, Switzerland.


## One-Stage DX Cycle

The classical one-stage direct expansion cycle is shown in Figure 1.
